# Demo-of-MCMC

These files are based on the class materials of AEROSP 567 taught by Prof. Alex Gorodetsky at University of Michigan. Author: Hung-Hsiang Liang

This repository provides some codes to demonstrate several variants of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) Algorithms. Including

1. Metropolis-Hastings MCMC (MH-MCMC)
2. Adaptive Metropolis MCMC (AM-MCMC)
3. Delayed Rejection MCMC (DR-MCMC)
4. Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis MCMC (DRAM-MCMC)

Two samples are provided for demostrating MCMC simulations:
1. Banana Function
2. SIR pandemic model

Please check the comments in the codes for details.
